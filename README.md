# CS-307--Mendelian-Genetics
This repository contains the three versions of a Genetics Simulation program that was made as part of the coursework for my OOP in C++ class. The release executables, source code, and proper input files can be found in the folder for each version.

Version 1: Text-based program that selects one allele from each of the Parent's genes to determine Offpsring genotype. Demonstrates principles of Mendelian inheritance and displays count for each organism genotype and phenotype.

Version 2: Another text-based program. This one demonstrates the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory, meaning that gene selection is not fully independent. Instead, each Parent donates the necessary number of Chromosomes, each containing a number of alleles. In addition to introducing Chromosomes, this version also calculates the likelihood of a genetic mutation as a result of chromosomal crossover.

Version 3: This is a UI-based implementation of the program from Version 2. In addition to providing UI-support, multiple batches of Offspring can be created without restarting the program, and the results of program can be saved to an output file specified by the user. Although multiple sets of genetic crosses can be performed, the program must still be restarted to initialize a new Simulation using a different text file.
